# VAXPRED

VAXPRED aims to improve the field of vaccine development supplying a cloud-based system where researchers can run simulations to generate predictions that assess the efficacy of immune responses against pathogens. These tools are provided through plugins that can be chosen accordingly to the experiment ran by the researcher, in a cloud-based store that we are developing. More details about the product can be found in the [product management](docs/product.md) documentation.
