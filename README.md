# VAXPRED

VAXPRED aims to improve the field of vaccine development supplying a cloud-based system where researchers can run simulations to generate predictions that assess the efficacy of immune responses against pathogens. These tools are provided through plugins that can be chosen accordingly to the experiment ran by the researcher, in a cloud-based store that we are developing. More details about the product can be found in the [product management](docs/product.md) documentation.

## How to use

We will explain how to use your software from user standpoint. This can include short videos, screenshots, or API documentation, depending on what makes sense for your particular software system and target users. More information can be found in the [docs](docs/) directory).

## How to contribute

The guidelines for the project are present here: [guidelines](docs/GUIDELINES.md).

We still don't have containers but later on we will explain what a new developer to the project should know in order to develop the system, including who to build, run and test it in a development environment.

More the details about the tecnical vision can be found in the [development](docs/development.md) documentation.

## How to run and operate in a production environment

We still don't have containers but later on we will explain how to package, deploy and run the system to a production (or production-like) environment. If needed, link to external resources or additional markdown files with further details (please place these in the [docs](docs/) directory).
