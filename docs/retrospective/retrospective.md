# Global Retrospective

## Sprint 0

We kickstarted the projected by a global meeting in which we formed the scrum teams and discussed the project's requirements imposed by the client, the vision of the project and the technologies we would use. We also discussed the project's architecture and the tasks we would have to do in the first sprint. There was a first meeting with the client. Every team contributed equally to the initial planning.

## Sprint 1

The first sprint was the bumpiest one, since the teams initiated the development under the chosen tools to do so. Everyone spent time learning about the technologies and practicing with tools that were new to some people. Initially the teams focused on assembling a prototype while also learning the new technologies. Unfortunately, the chosen GitHub workflow for the teams was actually causing overheads on merging and releasing the new versions, so it was decided to remove a layer from this to reduce troubles.

## Sprint 2

This sprint went a little better than the previous sprint as the teams were able to present new changes to the product and there weren't many items that had to be carried over to the next sprint. During this sprint most teams encountered time restrictions due to an increase in workload outside this project. However, this led to a better underrstanding of how these situations can be handled to ensure a quality release.
