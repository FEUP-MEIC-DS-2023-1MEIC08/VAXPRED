# T3 Retrospective

## Sprint 0

The team was focused on exploring the suggested technologies for development, nothing to add.

## Sprint 1

## What went well?
- Most developers expressed their doubts or concerns when needed
- Most developers feedbacked whenever a new feature was available to review
- The Scrum Master was able to partion the assigned work efficiently and redirect efforts to items that mattered the most
- The Product Owner was highly communicative

## What could be improved?
- The Scrum Master should poll a member's response to assert their progress if they become un-responsive for a long period of time 
- The Scrum Master should ask for help when needed
- Developers should not abandon communications and leave it for the next Spring Planning's to understand if they were able to work or not

## Sprint 2

## What went well?
- Some developers worked consistently well during the sprint
- The Scrum Master was able to partion the assigned work and assign more tasks for the most active developers
- The Product Owner kept on transmitting knowledge from her meetings to the team
- Issues that the Scrum Master was able to accomplish were assigned to the team members to reduce the SM's workload

## What could be improved?
- The Scrum Master should poll a member's response to assert their progress if they become un-responsive for a long period of time 
- Developers should not abandon communications and leave it for the next Spring Planning's to understand if they were able to work or not
