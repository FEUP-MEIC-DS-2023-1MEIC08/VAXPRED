# T4 Retrospective

## Sprint 0

The team was focused on exploring the suggested technologies for development, and planning the project.

## Sprint 1

## What went well?

- Developers were assigned to tasks in due time
- Developers communicated their progress throughout the sprint
- Developers communicated their doubts and concerns when needed
- The Product Owner did their job well by communicating with the other POs and the client
- The Scrum Master was able to partion the assigned work efficiently and redirect efforts to items that mattered the most

## What could be improved?

- Improve our scrum methodology and practices (commit messages, branch names, etc.)
- Developers should communicate their progress more frequently

## Sprint 2

## What went well?

- Developers were assigned to tasks in due time
- Developers communicated their progress throughout the sprint
- Developers communicated their doubts and concerns when needed
- The Product Owner did their job well by communicating with the other POs and the client

## What could be improved?

- We underestimated the time needed to complete a few tasks, so there were some that were moved back to the backlog
- Do better time management and estimation of time to complete our tasks
- Understand that people can have unplanned events that can affect their work, and plan accordingly

## Sprint 3

## What went well?

- Developers were assigned to tasks in due time
- Developers communicated their progress well throughout the sprint
- Developers communicated their doubts and concerns when needed
- The Product Owner did their job well by communicating with the other POs and the client
- The Scrum Master participated in an online meeting with the client on 29/11/2023. The client showed that they really liked the progress and that the website was looking good

## What could be improved?
