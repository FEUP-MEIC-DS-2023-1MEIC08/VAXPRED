## Product Vision

## Vision Statement

Towards an healthier future, VAXPRED aims to improve the field of vaccine development by allying the power of several technologies to allow researchers and scientists to advance their investigations providing a cloud-based system that supports different datasets from various sources, the support of pluggable tools, and a model pipeline that allows researchers to run simulations, in order to, generate predictions that test the efficacy of immune responses against pathogenes.  

## Key Features

- The application will offer a simulation enviroment with a few simulations, with parameters that can be tweaked, and the support to pluggable tools, allowing researchers to run an experiment and see the prediction results;
- It will be possible to use data of various types and sources. Users can upload data to the simulation enviroment or use data available at existing remote repositories;
- The platform will incorporate some models and the support to add new analytical tools provided under the form of software containers;
- The simulation outputs will be provided in convenient interfaces for the most common simulation parameters;
- The application will provide a set of envisions for the most relevant simulation outputs.


## Who Benefits from VAXPRED:

VAXPRED aims to improve the lives of several people:
- equips researchers and scientists with simulations to accelerate vaccine development;
- the platform reduces development costs and risks to the academic and biotech sectors of the industry;
- since faster vaccine development allows quicker and better responses to new virus and pathogens, public health is more safeguarded.

## Market Research

Survey of similar projects and analysis of their pros and cons when compared to the product to be developed. 

### Azure AI | Machine Learning Studio

The “Azure AI | Machine Learning Studio” aims to help developers and data scientists creating their own machine learning models faster using the AI services available in the platform. Various tools are available to be used on the platform, like Jupyter Notebooks and Visual Studio Code, as well as open-source frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. High-quality vision, speech, language, and decision-making AI models are also made available. The users have access to their Workspaces, where they can keep track of all the artifacts they create while performing experiments, to Feature Stores to create features, Registries that make it possible to share models with other people, and users can also store their data in the platform. 
The “Azure Ai | Machine Learning Studio” bears similarities with the VAXPRED platform on the presence of workspaces, various tools and models to chose from and the ability to store data, as well as having been created with the intention of being used by scientists. However, unlike VAXPRED, Azure AI is not focused on the study of epitopes, lacking tools related to that.

### Baidu's LinearFold

Baidu's LinearFold is an AI powered tool designed to predict the secondary structure of RNA molecules, particularly focusing on the structure of RNA molecules in viruses like the Covid-19 coronavirus. LinearFold uses AI algorithms to predict the secondary structure of RNA molecules. RNA molecules are essential components of viruses, and understanding their structure is crucial for various aspects of virus research, including vaccine development. By accurately predicting RNA structure, LinearFold aids in understanding the genetic makeup of viruses like Covid-19. This information is valuable for researchers working on vaccines. The tool relies on AI and machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of RNA structure prediction. It leverages AI to make predictions based on large datasets of RNA sequences.
Both LinearFold and Inno4Vac use advanced technology to accelerate vaccine research using large datasets. Inno4Vac incorporates scientific and technological advances into vaccine development, while LinearFold applies AI to predict RNA structures for virus research. Both initiatives highlight the importance of AI in addressing public health challenges. Inno4Vac incorporates AI for predictive modeling and data analysis in vaccine development, while LinearFold directly applies AI to RNA structure prediction.
