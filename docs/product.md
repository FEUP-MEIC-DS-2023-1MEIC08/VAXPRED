# Product Management

## Product Vision

Explain in few paragraphs what is the product vision that will guide the development of your product. Keep within ~1500 characters and user as reference the _Vision_ pattern in [The Scrum Book](http://scrumbook.org/).

### Vision Statement

Towards a healthier future. VAXPRED aims to improve the field of vaccine development by allying the power of artificial intelligence, computational modeling and big data, creating a powerful workspace that allows researchers and scientists to quickly advance their investigations. 

### Key Features

- The application will provide various workspaces, corresponding to experiments, offering different datasets, simulations and tools, allowing researchers to manage and organize their projects seamlessly.
- It will be possible to use data of various types users can data uploaded to the workspace, or data available at existing remote repositories;
- Synthetic data generation tools will be available, also data curation and quality-check tools for the considered data types;
- Incorporating new models and new analytical tools, provided under the form of software containers;
- Providing convenient interfaces for the most costumary simulation parameters;
- Providing a set of envisions for the most relevant simulation outputs;
- Allowing the definition of custom pipelines from the chaining of different processing tools.


### Who Benefits from VAXPRED:

VAXPRED aims to improve the lives of several people:
- equips researchers and scientists, with advanced tools to accelerate vaccine development;
- the platform reduces development costs and risks to the academic and biotech sectors of the industry;
- since faster vaccine development allows quicker and better responses to new virus and pathogens, public health is more safeguarded.

## Market Research

Survey of similar projects and analysis of their pros and cons when compared to the product to be developed. 

### Azure AI | Machine Learning Studio

The “Azure AI | Machine Learning Studio” aims to help developers and data scientists creating their own machine learning models faster using the AI services available in the platform. Various tools are available to be used on the platform, like Jupyter Notebooks and Visual Studio Code, as well as open-source frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. High-quality vision, speech, language, and decision-making AI models are also made available. The users have access to their Workspaces, where they can keep track of all the artifacts they create while performing experiments, to Feature Stores to create features, Registries that make it possible to share models with other people, and users can also store their data in the platform. 
The “Azure Ai | Machine Learning Studio” bears similarities with the VAXPRED platform on the presence of workspaces, various tools and models to chose from and the ability to store data, as well as having been created with the intention of being used by scientists. However, unlike VAXPRED, Azure AI is not focused on the study of epitopes, lacking tools related to that.

### Baidu's LinearFold

Baidu's LinearFold is an AI powered tool designed to predict the secondary structure of RNA molecules, particularly focusing on the structure of RNA molecules in viruses like the Covid-19 coronavirus. LinearFold uses AI algorithms to predict the secondary structure of RNA molecules. RNA molecules are essential components of viruses, and understanding their structure is crucial for various aspects of virus research, including vaccine development. By accurately predicting RNA structure, LinearFold aids in understanding the genetic makeup of viruses like Covid-19. This information is valuable for researchers working on vaccines. The tool relies on AI and machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of RNA structure prediction. It leverages AI to make predictions based on large datasets of RNA sequences.
Both LinearFold and Inno4Vac use advanced technology to accelerate vaccine research using large datasets. Inno4Vac incorporates scientific and technological advances into vaccine development, while LinearFold applies AI to predict RNA structures for virus research. Both initiatives highlight the importance of AI in addressing public health challenges. Inno4Vac incorporates AI for predictive modeling and data analysis in vaccine development, while LinearFold directly applies AI to RNA structure prediction.

## Sprint Reviews

Record of each sprint review, stating *when* they happened, *which version* was demonstrated (refer to specific git tags and/or version number of the product increment), and the main feedback provided by the customer. Refer also to the consequences of that feedback to the planning of the product, when relevant.
