# Product Management

## Product Vision

Explain in few paragraphs what is the product vision that will guide the development of your product. Keep within ~1500 characters and user as reference the _Vision_ pattern in [The Scrum Book](http://scrumbook.org/).

### Vision Statement

Towards a healthier future. VAXPRED aims to improve the field of vaccine development by allying the power of artificial intelligence, computational modeling and big data, creating a powerful workspace that allows researchers and scientists to quickly advance their investigations. 

### Key Features

- The application will provide various workspaces, corresponding to experiments, offering different datasets, simulations and tools, allowing researchers to manage and organize their projects seamlessly.
- It will be possible to use data of various types users can data uploaded to the workspace, or data available at existing remote repositories;
- Synthetic data generation tools will be available, also data curation and quality-check tools for the considered data types;
- Incorporating new models and new analytical tools, provided under the form of software containers;
- Providing convenient interfaces for the most costumary simulation parameters;
- Providing a set of envisions for the most relevant simulation outputs;
- Allowing the definition of custom pipelines from the chaining of different processing tools.


### Who Benefits from VAXPRED:

VAXPRED aims to improve the lives of several people:
- equips researchers and scientists, with advanced tools to accelerate vaccine development;
- the platform reduces development costs and risks to the academic and biotech sectors of the industry;
- since faster vaccine development allows quicker and better responses to new virus and pathogens, public health is more safeguarded.

## Market Research

Survey of similar projects and analysis of their pros and cons when compared to the product to be developed. 


## Domain Analysis

Include high-level class diagram with key domain concepts. Complement this diagram with other high-level diagrams has appropriate (activity, sequence, etc.).

## Sprint Reviews

Record of each sprint review, stating *when* they happened, *which version* was demonstrated (refer to specific git tags and/or version number of the product increment), and the main feedback provided by the customer. Refer also to the consequences of that feedback to the planning of the product, when relevant.
