## Overall Product


### Technical Soundness

I helped in the developing the overall look of all pages by developing a navbar and also helped develop both home and search page features, namely the tags filter feature at the bottom of the home page.

### Product Realization

I believe the homepage and plugin store I assisted in developing have successfully reached a positive outcome, showcasing practical features and a distinct "professional" impression.


### Value for the Client

Based on the feedback received, despite not feeling like I was at a 100% some times, I felt like we developed a product that the client will be happy with its final form, team is happy, no complaints given.
