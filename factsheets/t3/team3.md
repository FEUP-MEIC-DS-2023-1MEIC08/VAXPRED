## Sprint 1

### The four user stories that we are most proud of

 * "As a researcher, I want to have a plugin store, so that I can see all the plugins available." [issue #13](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/13)
 * "As a researcher, I want to see a store-like grid when I go to the plugin store, so that I can easily see all the plugins available." [issue #33](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/33)


 Issue #13 was the main issue of this Sprint, having issue #33 associated to it. Issue #33 was the only User Story given to the team for this Sprint, with the user Story being "divided" into various items that were implemented by the Developers, like [issue #66](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/66).


### The four pull requests that we are most proud of

 * "Sprint 0 release" [#30](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/30)
 * "T3 feature side filter & home page" [#86](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/86)

Pull Request #30 was reviewed by one of the team's Developers while Pull Request #86 was made and reviewed by the team's Developers to properly add a new feature into the rest of the work.


### Four contributions of other types that we are most proud of

* Creating Mockups for various pages of the platform (like the one present in issue [#67's](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/67) description)
* Creating Acceptance tests for the plugin store grid (like the ones present in issue [#66's](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/66) description)
* The Team's PO helped writing more User Stories that will hopefully be implemented in the future
