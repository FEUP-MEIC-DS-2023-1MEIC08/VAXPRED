## Overall Product


### Technical Soundness

  I helped in developing the search page functionalities, mainly the filter bar on the left and the results that appear. In the homepage, I also helped in showing the categories and the plugins of each category.


### Product Realization
 
  I believe the homepage and plugin store I assisted in developing have successfully reached a positive outcome, showcasing practical features and a distinct "professional" impression.

### Value for the Client

  Based on the feedback received, the client expressed satisfaction with the final outcome. Despite the distribution of the work in the beggining felt a little uneven, it seemed to work well in the end. Overral, the effort was appropriate and everyone worked well together.
