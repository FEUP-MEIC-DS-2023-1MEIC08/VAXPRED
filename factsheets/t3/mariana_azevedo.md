# Factsheet for Mariana Azevedo

## Sprint 0

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * "As a researcher, I want to be able to search for a plugin's name in the store, so that I can find it quickly." [issue #23](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/23)
 * "As a researcher, I want to be able to filter the plugins by various tags, so that I can find the one that suits better the experiment I want to do."  [issue #24](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/24)

 I wrote these two user stories thinking that being able to better search for plugins in the store will improve the user-friendliness of the platform. The other POs helped revising the user stories.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No pull requests were made during this sprint.


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

 * The writing of the [Product Vision](/docs/product.md)
 * The creation of the [Domain Model](/docs/product.md)

 Writing the Product Vision and creating the Domain Model together with the other POs was especially important for understanding what is supposed to be done on this project and will certainly be of much help in future sprints to be able to guide the teams and achieve the best results.



## Sprint 1

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * "As I researcher, I want to be able see the plugin's supplier email, so that I can directly communicate with them in case I need to." [issue #84](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/84)
 * "As a researcher, I want to see a store-like grid when I go to the plugin store, so that I can easily see all the plugins available." [issue  #33](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/33)

Issue #84 was one of the newly added User Stories during this Sprint, it was written among all the POs and I think it is important as it will improve the user's experience using the platform. Issue #33 was the one assigned to my team for this Sprint, and the Developers did a great work implementing some of the items related to it.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

I did not implement nor review any pull request during this Sprint. I have however contributed to the Definition of Ready and Done that were added to the docs folder, what needed a Pull Request to be done.


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of
 
 * Writing the Definitions of Ready and Done with the other POs
 * Writing more User Stories with the other POs

I think having good Definitions of Ready and Done will be important for the work to flow better on the next Sprints, just like having good User Stories already written will be important to have a good start of Sprint 2.



## Sprint 2

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * "As a researcher, I want to be able to see the plugins' store home page, so that I can see all the plugins right away and easily go to other sections of the application." [issue #132](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/132)
 * "As a researcher, I want to be able to filter the plugins by various tags, so that I can find the one that suits better the experiment I want to do." [issue #24](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/24)

Both user stories were written by all POs and I am proud of them as they were assigned to my team, who did a good job creating the filters and is on the right track to create a nice looking home page for the platform, which is important as it will be the first thing the user sees when entering the plugin store.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

I did not create nor review any pull request during this Sprint.


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of
 
 * Writing more User Stories with the other POs
 * Helping my team members understand what should be done about certain user stories

The team members were confused about user stories  [#14](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/14) and [#132](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/132)but after I rewrote and explained them the work could continue without problems.


## Sprint 3

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * "As a researcher, I want to be able to see a "Free" symbol, so that I can know which plugins are free for all the users." [issue #162](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/162)
 * "As a researcher, I want to be able to see a "Premium" symbol, so that I can see which plugins are payed for industrial companies."  [issue #163](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/163)

These user-stories were written by the POs after talking with the client. I am proud because my team did well implementing their part regarding these user-stories (adding "Free" and "Premium" symbols to the plugin's cards in the store), which will make the store better.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

I did not review nor create any pull request during this sprint.


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

 * Taking part in reunions with the clients
 * Writing more User Stories with the other POs

The reunions with the clients helped figure out what else could be done to have a better plugin store, leading to more user stories.
