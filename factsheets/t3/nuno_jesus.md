# Factsheet for Nuno Jesus

## Sprint 0

In this sprint, my roles were deciding which tecnologies should for development, estimating the efforts of User Stories and also guiding both developers and teams on how to work with version control across sprints. 

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

No user stories were implemented in this sprint.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No pull requests were created in this sprint.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- Developed a small Git/GitHub tutorial (`INFO.md`, currently present on the `prototype` branch)to set how the teams should work for the rest of the semester. It also fostered useful git commands, so the developers can work at similar levels.

## Sprint 1

In this sprint, I planned how to tackle the Plugin Store creation by assigning small tasks to my team, such as creating small components to assemble them all. Also, I made sure to design an UI for the Store (with Frederico) as well as creating the plugin card component, which briefly describes what a plugin is about.
