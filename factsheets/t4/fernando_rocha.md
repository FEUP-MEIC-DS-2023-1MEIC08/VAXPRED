# Factsheet for Fernando Rocha

## Sprint 0

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

User Stories were conceived by the POs and estimated by the SMs. In this sprint I was a Scrum Master and helped prioritize, estimate and discuss the user stories with the fellow SMs, in preparation for the next Sprint Planning. It's important to note that the User Stories were changed shortly after the Sprint 0 forced-closure, so we had to rediscuss them in the next Sprint Planning.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No Pull Requests were made during this sprint.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- Meeting with the remaining three Scrum Masters to discuss and estimate the User Stories.
- Informing my team of the progress and development of the project, as well as the next steps to be taken during this initial phase.
- Contributing with ideas and suggestions to the User Stories and general project development.

## Sprint 1

This sprint was successful in terms of team work and collaboration. We, as a whole (all teams), started communicating with each other a bit too late but we managed to unify our code so we could merge and form a release. For example, we had to communicate with Team 2 to understand how the Database API setup was working, and how we could integrate it.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [(#34) As a researcher, I want to have a profile page, so that I can see all the plugins I am using.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/34)

My team and I are proud of this User Story because it includes all the tasks we did in this Sprint as Team 4.

In particular, I worked on the following:

- Issue #38 (Mockups for the researcher's profile): I created mockups on a Figma canvas with the entire team (Rodrigo, JoÃ£o, Juan and Pedro). I created a common Figma project to join every team's mockups.
- Issue #46 (Create a profile page): I worked with Rodrigo on creating the user profile page component with its frontend and basic backend, ready for the other team members to work on
- Issue #74 (Connect user profile page to API (use real data)): I worked with Rodrigo (and later Pedro) on fetching data for the user & their plugins.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [(#90) User profile page (work by Team 4)](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/90)

This is the team's pull request that merges all of our common work into the dev branch which will form the next release into main.

- [(#30) Sprint 0 release](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/30)

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- As a scrum master, I believe I did my job well in orienting and supporting my team in accomplishing their tasks. I provided organisation and kept everyone up to date with each other's progress. We kept the team's to-do list updated nad were always communicating with each other. I managed to get every one to meet before the closure of Sprint 1.
- I also participated with other Scrum Masters in weighing user story efforts and discussing the product and sprint backlogs.
