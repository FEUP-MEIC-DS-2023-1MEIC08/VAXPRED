# Factsheet for Fernando Rocha

## Sprint 0

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

User Stories were conceived by the POs and estimated by the SMs. In this sprint I was a Scrum Master and helped prioritize, estimate and discuss the user stories with the fellow SMs, in preparation for the next Sprint Planning. It's important to note that the User Stories were changed shortly after the Sprint 0 forced-closure, so we had to rediscuss them in the next Sprint Planning.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No Pull Requests were made during this sprint.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- Meeting with the remaining three Scrum Masters to discuss and estimate the User Stories.
- Informing my team of the progress and development of the project, as well as the next steps to be taken during this initial phase.
- Contributing with ideas and suggestions to the User Stories and general project development.
