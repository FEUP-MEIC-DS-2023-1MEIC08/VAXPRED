# Factsheet for Martim Henriques

## Sprint 0

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * "As a researcher I want to be able to add the plugins I want from the plugins store to my profile, so that I can use them in my experiments." [issue 21](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/21). 

 * "As a researcher, I want to be able to remove the plugins from my profile, so that I can discard plugins that are not relevant for my current experiments." [issue 22](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/22)

Together with rest of the team of product owners, I wrote these two user stories as it would ease the action of adding and removing plugins directly from the users profile

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

As a PO, I did not participate in any pull request.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

 * The writing of the [Product Vision](/docs/product.md)
 * The creation of the [Domain Model](/docs/product.md)

Writing the Product Vision and creating the Domain Model together with the other POs was really important for understanding the direction that our future product must follows and the needs of our clients.

## Sprint 1

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * "As a researcher, I want to have a profile page, so that I can see all the plugins I am using." [issue #34](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/34) 

 * "As a researcher, I want to see the dependencies of a plugin, so that I can be aware if a specific plugin is compatible with the tools on my workspace." [issue #80](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/80)

 Issue #34 was the one assigned to my team for Sprint 1, and the Developers did a great work implementing the items related to it.
 
 Issue #80 was one of the newly added User Stories during this Sprint, it was written among all the POs and it is one the most important as it has direct impact in how the plugin affects the researcher work.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

As a PO, I did not participate in any pull request.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of
 
 * Updating the market research 
 * Writing more User Stories with the other POs

Having good User Stories already written is important to have a good start of Sprint 2, as well as have a good base of the market research so that all the worked is well guided.
