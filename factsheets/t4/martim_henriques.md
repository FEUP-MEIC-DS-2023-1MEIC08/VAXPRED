# Factsheet for Martim Henriques

## Sprint 0

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * "As a researcher I want to be able to add the plugins I want from the plugins store to my profile, so that I can use them in my experiments." [issue 21](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/21). 

 * "As a researcher, I want to be able to remove the plugins from my profile, so that I can discard plugins that are not relevant for my current experiments." [issue 22](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/22)

Together with rest of the team of product owners, I wrote these two user stories as it would ease the action of adding and removing plugins directly from the users profile

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

As a PO, I did not participate in any pull request.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

 * The writing of the [Product Vision](/docs/product.md)
 * The creation of the [Domain Model](/docs/product.md)

Writing the Product Vision and creating the Domain Model together with the other POs was really important for understanding the direction that our future product must follows and the needs of our clients.

## Sprint 1

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * "As a researcher, I want to have a profile page, so that I can see all the plugins I am using." [issue #34](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/34) 

 * "As a researcher, I want to see the dependencies of a plugin, so that I can be aware if a specific plugin is compatible with the tools on my workspace." [issue #80](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/80)

 Issue #34 was the one assigned to my team for Sprint 1, and the Developers did a great work implementing the items related to it.
 
 Issue #80 was one of the newly added User Stories during this Sprint, it was written among all the POs and it is one the most important as it has direct impact in how the plugin affects the researcher work.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * "As an admin, I want to have a page where I can add new plugins to the store, so that the plugins become available to the researchers." [issue #77](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/77) 

 * "As an admin, I want a form where I can add fields to create a new plugin, so that I can add it to the store." [issue #134](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/134)

I've decided to highlight these two issues, that complement each other, as they are important for an admin's experience.

## Overall Product

### Technical Soundness

Having the role of product owner, I had the responsability to help and inform the developers, more specifically Team 4, on what technologies and ideas the client preferred to be used on the product. I also aided communicating between all teams, in order to ensure a good work flow.

### Product Realization

As part of the unofficial team of PO's, we wrote user stories containing ideas that the client transmited and some others that came up throughtout the development. These US helped the product reach the final stage with the required features implemented.


### Value for the Client

The final product demonstrates what the client desired, it allows to interact with all the plugins that a researcher may want to use. In meetings with the client, we had that value was acknowledged.
