# Factsheet for Juan Ignacio Medone Sabatini


## Sprint 0
As a developer there wasn't much to do at this early stage, so I mainly reviewed the work done by the PO's and SM's about the product vision and backlog. Also started to get familiar with the technologies that we are going to use during the project.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of
User stories were conceived by the POs and estimated by the SMs, but none of them were implemented on this sprint.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of
No pull requests were made during this sprint.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of
Proposing some ideas and making technical suggestions about the repository management.


## Sprint 1
In this sprint I mainly participated in the implementation of the plugins list in the user profile page component and the acceptance tests.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of
As a team we all worked on the following user story:

[(#34) As a researcher, I want to have a profile page, so that I can see all the plugins I am using](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/34)

I worked specifically on these issues:
- [Issue #38 (Mockups for the researcher's profile):](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/38) The mockups for the researcher's profile were collaboratively created by the entire team, including Fernando, Jo達o, Juan, and Rodrigo.
- [Issue #50 (Create list with 'my plugins'):](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/50) The development of the 'My Plugins' list for the user profile page component was a joint effort between Rodrigo and me, primarily focusing on the frontend aspects.
- [Issue #52 (Acceptance tests are created for the profile page):](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/52) I helped Jo達o to fix some errors encountered while coding the tests.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of
- [(#90) User profile page (work by Team 4):](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/90)
This was the only pull request for this sprint and it was made to merge all the work from our team into the dev branch.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of
I made myself available to the team in order to participate in the calls and help in what was necessary.


## Sprint 2
In this sprint I mainly worked on the display of the plugins' FAQ on their respective pages.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of
- [Issue #157 (Display a 'Store' Button in the navbar)](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/157)
- [Issue #124 (Display a plugin's FAQ in its page):](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/124) Work in progress with Jo達o in branch feat-display-faq.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of
- [(#158) feature: added 'Store' button to the navbar:](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/158) Adding this little functionality is worth at least for the sprint review and demo.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of
- Was able to detect some bugs in dev branch caused by other PRs while testing the entire application.
- Reported these bugs to the respective teams and they were able to fix them.


## Sprint 3
My principal objective of this sprint was to finish the uncompleted work of last sprint, as it was larger than initially expected.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of
- [Issue #124 (Display a plugin's FAQ in its page):](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/124) Resumed the work of last sprint with Jo達o.
- [US #83 (As a researcher, I want to have access to the plugin's FAQ, so that I can clarify some common questions about the plugin):](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/83) This user story was a joint work with team 2 that involved [#124](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/124) and [#126](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/126).

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of
- [(#209) Feature: display FAQ:](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/209) This pull request successfully closed [#83](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/83).

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of
- Regularly merged dev branch into the working one and consciously fixed the incoming conflicts in order to leave the new features working correctly.
- Detected a bug related to the zoom in the search page view.


## Sprint 4
The focus of this last sprint was to improve and ensure the correct overall performance of the app, and in my particular case I mainly worked on fixing component tests.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of
- [Issue #224 (Fix component tests regarding the profile and admin page):](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/224) First of all I had to make all the project's testsuite able to run by fixing several spec compiling issues, and then fixed my team components tests so they can run successfully.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of
- [(#247) T4 - Fix: frontend tests execution:](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/247) First step of the work for [#224](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/224), making all the frontend tests able to be executed.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of
- Reviewed and approved Fernando's work in [(#246) T4 - Remake User Profile UI](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/246) pull request.
- Contributed with team 2 in fixing new bugs related to the plugin page component that appeared when some API routes were changed.


## Overall Product

### Technical Soundness
Even though I had no prior knowledge on most of the technologies used in the project, I managed to learn how to use them following the recommended practices and always trying to leave the code in the most clean and readable way as possible.

### Product Realization
I was involved in the development of multiple frontend components and in the testing of these. Also, I reported several bugs of related issues that I was able to find and fixed most of them myself.

### Value for the Client
What I can remark to be the most valuable consequences of my work to the client are the user profile interface and the FAQ's display of each plugin on their respective pages. These elements were elaborated with a focus on delivering the optimal user experience.
