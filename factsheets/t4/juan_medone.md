# Factsheet for Juan Ignacio Medone Sabatini


## Sprint 0

As a developer there wasn't much to do at this early stage, so I mainly reviewed the work done by the PO's and SM's about the product vision and backlog. Also started to get familiar with the technologies that we are going to use during the project.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

User stories were conceived by the POs and estimated by the SMs, but none of them were implemented on this sprint.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No pull requests were made during this sprint.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

Proposing some ideas and making technical suggestions about the repository management.


## Sprint 1

In this sprint I mainly participated in the implementation of the plugins list in the user profile page component and the acceptance tests.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

As a team we all worked on the following user story:

[(#34) As a researcher, I want to have a profile page, so that I can see all the plugins I am using.]([url](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/34))

I worked specifically on these issues:

- [Issue #38 (Mockups for the researcher's profile):]([url](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/38)) The mockups for the researcher's profile were collaboratively created by the entire team, including Fernando, João, Juan, and Rodrigo.
- [Issue #50 (Create list with 'my plugins'):]([url](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/50)) The development of the 'My Plugins' list for the user profile page component was a joint effort between Rodrigo and me, primarily focusing on the frontend aspects.
- [Issue #52 (Acceptance tests are created for the profile page):]([url](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/52)) I helped João to fix some errors encountered while coding the tests.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

[(#90) User profile page (work by Team 4)]([url](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/90))
This was the only pull request for this sprint and it was made to merge all the work from our team into the dev branch.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

I made myself available to the team in order to participate in the calls and help in what was necessary.
