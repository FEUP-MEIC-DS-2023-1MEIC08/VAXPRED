# Factsheet for Juan Ignacio Medone Sabatini

## Sprint 0

As a developer there wasn't much to do at this early stage, so I mainly reviewed the work done by the PO's and SM's about the product vision and backlog. Also started to get familiar with the technologies that we are going to use during the project.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

User stories were conceived by the POs and estimated by the SMs, but none of them were implemented on this sprint.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No pull requests were made during this sprint.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

Proposing some ideas and making technical suggestions about the repository management.
