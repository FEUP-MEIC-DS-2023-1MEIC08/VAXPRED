## Sprint 1

In this sprint, I contributed to the implementation of the plugin list of the user profile page component and made it connect to the API. 

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

During this sprint, I worked on the following user story: 

- [(#34) As a researcher, I want to have a profile page, so that I can see all the plugins I am using.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/34)

It was the main user story of our team and we all worked on it. 

I worked specifically on these issues:

- Issue #38 (Mockups for the researcher's profile): The mockups for the researcher's profile were collaboratively created by the entire team, including Fernando, JoÃ£o, Juan, and Rodrigo.
- Issue #50 (Create list with 'my plugins'): The development of the 'My Plugins' list for the user profile page component was a joint effort between me and Juan, primarily focusing on the frontend aspects.
- Issue #74 (Connect user profile page to API (use real data)): I helped Rodrigo and Fernando with fetching the data for the user and plugins using the API

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [(#90) User profile page (work by Team 4)](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/90)

This was the only pull request for this sprint and it was made to merge all the work from our team into the dev branch.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- I was ready to meet and work at any time it was required.

## Sprint 2

In this sprint, I contributed to the implementation of the removal of a plugin from a user profile page and also fixed the tests from the user profile component.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [(#22) As a researcher, I want to be able to remove the plugins from my profile, so that I can discard plugins that are not relevant for my current experiments.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/22)

I made the remove button of each plugin in our user profile page make an API call to disassociate the plugin from the current user, and refresh the page to update the list visually.

- [(#106) Fix tests for user-profile component](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/106)

This was required to fix some issues created in the previous sprint regarding the tests we created for the user-profile component.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [(#147) Feature user profile remove plugin button](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/147)

This PR was to merge the work made for issue #22 to the dev branch of our repository.

- [(#146) Fix for tests of the user-profile component](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/146)

I made this PR to merge the fixes for our user-profile component to the dev branch of our repository.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- I was ready to meet and work at any time it was required.

## Sprint 3

In this sprint, I worked on the implementation of the create plugin form in the admin page.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [(#77) As an admin, I want to have a page where I can manage plugins in the store, so that I can add, edit and/or remove the plugins from the store.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/77)

In this sprint, I only worked on this user story, more specifically on the task [(#134)](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/134), as this was a very time-consuming feature to implement. To finish the task, I created a form on the admin page, that allows the creation of new plugins.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [(#225) T4 - Feat: Add new plugin via admin dashboard](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/225)

Since I only worked on one task, I also only made one Pull Request. This Pull Request was to merge the work made for issue [(#134)](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/134) to the dev branch of our repository.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- Offered to help with issues related to my previous work.
- I was ready to meet and work at any time it was required.

## Sprint 4

In this sprint, I worked on fixes for the create and update plugin form on the admin dashboard page.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [(#221) Connect small details that are not working in the overall project due to their dependency of the database.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/221)
- [(#223) Finish the integration of the backend with the frontend.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/223)

In this sprint, I worked on both of these issues. To finish the task, I updated the create and update form on the admin dashboard page to work with the changes made to our API.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [(#261) T4 fix admin panel create/update plugin form](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/261)

The work of both of my user stories was merged into the dev branch using this Pull Request. This made it so that an admin could create or update the data of a plugin.
