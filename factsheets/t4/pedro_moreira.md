## Sprint 1

In this sprint, I contributed to the implementation of the plugin list of the user profile page component and made it connect to API. 

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

During this sprint, I worked on the following user story: 

- [(#34) As a researcher, I want to have a profile page, so that I can see all the plugins I am using.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/34)

It was the main user story of our team and we all worked on it. 

I worked specifically on these issues:

- Issue #38 (Mockups for the researcher's profile): The mockups for the researcher's profile were collaboratively created by the entire team, including Fernando, JoÃ£o, Juan, and Rodrigo.
- Issue #50 (Create list with 'my plugins'): The development of the 'My Plugins' list for the user profile page component was a joint effort between me and Juan, primarily focusing on the frontend aspects.
- Issue #74 (Connect user profile page to API (use real data)): I helped Rodrigo and Fernando with fetching the data for the user and plugins using the API

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [(#90) User profile page (work by Team 4)](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/90)

This was the only pull request for this sprint and it was made to merge all the work from our team into the dev branch.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- I was ready to meet and work at any time it was required.

## Sprint 2

In this sprint, I contributed to the implementation of the removal of a plugin from a user profile page and also fixed the tests from the user-profile component.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [(#22) As a researcher, I want to be able to remove the plugins from my profile, so that I can discard plugins that are not relevant for my current experiments.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/22)

I made the remove button of each plugin in our user profile page make an API call to dissassociate the plugin with the current user, and refresh page to update the list visually.

- [(#106) Fix tests for user-profile component](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/106)

This was required to fix some issues created in the previous sprint regarding the tests we created for the user-profile component.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [(#147) Feature user profile remove plugin button](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/147)

This PR was to merge the work made for issue #22 to the dev branch of our repository.

- [(#146) Fix for tests of the user-profile component](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/146)

I made this PR to merge the fixes for our user-profile compoment to the dev branch of our repository.
