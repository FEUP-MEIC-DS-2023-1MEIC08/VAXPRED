## Sprint 1

### The four user stories that we are most proud of

We are proud of one user story that consists of several tasks which was the sole focus of our team during this sprint.

- [(#34) As a researcher, I want to have a profile page, so that I can see all the plugins I am using.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/34)

### The four pull requests that we are most proud of

- [(#90) User profile page (work by Team 4)](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/90)

### Four contributions of other types that we are most proud of

- We were pioneers in creating a common Figma project for everyone to share their UI Mockups in.
- Communicating with other teams in order to reach agreements regarding UI style & components, as well as integrating the API by Team 2.
- Working with the POs in a joint effort to organize and weigh the project's user stories.

In addition, we recognize that we had some inaccuracies in our GitHub usage. We had only one branch, '*t4-dev*', instead of a main branch and separate branches for each feature. This approach would have led to more pull requests and a better Git practice overall.
