No pull requests were created in this sprint.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

Collecting information about the product and reviewing the accomplished work.


## Sprint 1

At this sprint I was initially involved on the development of the mockups for the user profile page. Later, I contributed to the development of the user profile page component and worked on connecting the user profile page with the API.
I also took some time before starting the development to learn more about angular, but at the end the sprint was successful.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

During this sprint I worked on the following user story:

- [(#34) As a researcher, I want to have a profile page, so that I can see all the plugins I am using.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/34)

The whole team worked on this user story and all of us were proud about it since this user story included all the tasks our team needed to do in this sprint.

I was involved particularly on the following:

- Issue #38 (Mockups for the researcher's profile): I created the mockups for the researcher's profile with the help of all the team (Fernando, Jo√£o, Juan and Pedro).
- Issue #46 (Create a profile page): Me and Fernando worked on the development of the user profile page component, specially on the frontend, providing the structure for the rest of the development to be carried by the other team members.
- Issue #74 (Connect user profile page to API (use real data)): I worked with Fernando on fetching data for the user and their plugins, with Pedro also providing valuable help.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [(#90) User profile page (work by Team 4)](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/90)

The only pull request for this sprint was the one that merges all the work from our team into the dev branch.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- I made myself available to every team member in order to help in what was necessary.
- I helped assuring everything for this sprint was well organized and completed in time, while communicating regularly with all members of the team, but specially with Fernando, our Scrum Master, who did his job perfectly.

## Sprint 2

In this sprint I started to work on the urgent task of removing the CoreUI dependency. Later, I developed the mockup for the admin page and finally, worked on the development of the plugin removal functionality via the admin page.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [(#116) User Profile: remove CoreUI dependency](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/116)

This task needed to be urgently done since CoreUI was conflicting with other parts of the project, therefore it was treated with high priority. To accomplish this task, I immediately started exploring different alternatives to CoreUI alongside Fernando and we managed to reach the desired result while using Angular Material, Angular Flex Layout and regular CSS.

- [(#135) As an admin, I want to remove a plugin from the store on the admin dashboard.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/135)

For this task I implemented a list with all the plugins on the admin page, with the possibilty of removing them directly from that page while having to confirm the action on a pop-up. Fernando guided me during this implementation while we followed a pair-programming strategy. He also implemented the API route that I needed to use for the removal of the plugin.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [(#156) Refactor: Removal of CoreUI dependency from the User Profile component page](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/156)

This pull request merged the removal of the CoreUI dependency to the branch where every team was working from, so it was extremely important. It gave some conflicts, but after some time resolving them it was possible to merge the pull request, removing all the conflicts caused by CoreUI.

- [(#180) Feature: Removal of plugins from the store via the admin page](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/180)

This PR merged the implementation of the plugin removal functionality, a task that was part of an "X-Large" user story.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- I made the mockup for the admin page through Figma. This mockup was the starting point for the user story related to the admin page.
- I was always active and communicated frequently with all teams, making myself available to help in what was necessary.

## Sprint 3

For this sprint, I only worked on implementing one of the tasks as there weren't much tasks and even though I made myself available to help on any task, it wasn't needed. I also reviewed a PR and was always active in order to ensure everything was going alright.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [(#192) Add a confirmation popup for disassociating a user plugin](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/92)

This task consisted on implementing a pop-up in order for the user to confirm the action of disassociating a plugin from it's profile. It was important that the disassociation of a user's plugin required additional confirmation instead of just clicking on the "X" one time.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [(#204) Feature: Added confirmation pop-up for plugin disassociation on user profile](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/204)

This pull request merged the implementation of the confirmation pop-up for the plugin disassociation on user profiles to the branch where every team was working from.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- I reviewed a PR, assuring the task was correctly done and everything was working as expected.
- I made myself available to help on everything that was necessary and was always active.

## Sprint 4

This sprint was mostly focused on improvements for what was already done. I was in charge of writing documentation for the code that our team developed across all sprints.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [(#218) Write documentation about the profile page.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/218)
- [(#218) Write documentation about the admin page.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/234)

These tasks consisted on writing documentation for the admin and profile pages, the pages that our team developed. For that I used JSDoc comments and Compodoc to generate the documentation.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [(#260) T4 - Feat: Add documentation for user profile and admin pages](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/260)

This pull request merged the added documentation to the branch where every team was working from.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- Regarding the documentation, instead of using just JSDoc comments, I searched for a tool that could make the documentation visible on a web interface. I found out that Compodoc could achieve that, so I proposed its usage to other teams.
- I made myself available to help on everything that was necessary and was always active.

## Overall Product

### Technical Soundness

Contributed for the development of various features while always following the best practices, assuring the code was readable, maintainable and followed the specified standards. Additionally, made a clear and comprehensive documentation for the code developed by our team, assuring the reliability and stability of the project.

### Product Realization

I was involved in the devolopment of the user profile and admin pages, working on a diverse range of features such as the user interface or the logic behind it. Finished all the tasks that were assigned to me and helped my team on other tasks whenever it was needed. I was always available to communicate with everyone and to complete any task. Apart from the typical user stories I also helped fixing critical bugs and in general, produced robust code. All these contributions helped the realization of the project.

### Value for the Client

All my contributions were important and added value for the client. Both the user profile page and the admin page are key parts of the project and we produced an enhanced user interface ensuring a good user experience, while also ensuring that the logic behind the interface was flawless. The produced documentation is also important for the client as it helps the client to have a better understanding of the project and its features.
