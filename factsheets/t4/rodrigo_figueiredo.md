### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

Collecting information about the product and reviewing the accomplished work.


## Sprint 1

At this sprint I was initially involved on the development of the mockups for the user profile page. Later, I contributed to the development of the user profile page component and worked on connecting the user profile page with the API.
I also took some time before starting the development to learn more about angular, but at the end the sprint was successful.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

During this sprint I worked on the following user story:

- [(#34) As a researcher, I want to have a profile page, so that I can see all the plugins I am using.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/34)

The whole team worked on this user story and all of us were proud about it since this user story included all the tasks our team needed to do in this sprint.

I was involved particularly on the following:

- Issue #38 (Mockups for the researcher's profile): I created the mockups for the researcher's profile with the help of all the team (Fernando, JoÃ£o, Juan and Pedro).
- Issue #46 (Create a profile page): Me and Fernando worked on the development of the user profile page component, specially on the frontend, providing the structure for the rest of the development to be carried by the other team members.
- Issue #74 (Connect user profile page to API (use real data)): I worked with Fernando on fetching data for the user and their plugins, with Pedro also providing valuable help.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [(#90) User profile page (work by Team 4)](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/90)

The only pull request for this sprint was the one that merges all the work from our team into the dev branch.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- I made myself available to every team member in order to help in what was necessary.
- I helped assuring everything for this sprint was well organized and completed in time, while communicating regularly with all members of the team, but specially with Fernando, our Scrum Master, who did his job perfectly.
