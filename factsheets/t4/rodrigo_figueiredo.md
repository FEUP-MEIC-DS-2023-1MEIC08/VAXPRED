No pull requests were created in this sprint.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

Collecting information about the product and reviewing the accomplished work.


## Sprint 1

At this sprint I was initially involved on the development of the mockups for the user profile page. Later, I contributed to the development of the user profile page component and worked on connecting the user profile page with the API.
I also took some time before starting the development to learn more about angular, but at the end the sprint was successful.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

During this sprint I worked on the following user story:

- [(#34) As a researcher, I want to have a profile page, so that I can see all the plugins I am using.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/34)

The whole team worked on this user story and all of us were proud about it since this user story included all the tasks our team needed to do in this sprint.

I was involved particularly on the following:

- Issue #38 (Mockups for the researcher's profile): I created the mockups for the researcher's profile with the help of all the team (Fernando, JoÃ£o, Juan and Pedro).
- Issue #46 (Create a profile page): Me and Fernando worked on the development of the user profile page component, specially on the frontend, providing the structure for the rest of the development to be carried by the other team members.
- Issue #74 (Connect user profile page to API (use real data)): I worked with Fernando on fetching data for the user and their plugins, with Pedro also providing valuable help.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [(#90) User profile page (work by Team 4)](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/90)

The only pull request for this sprint was the one that merges all the work from our team into the dev branch.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- I made myself available to every team member in order to help in what was necessary.
- I helped assuring everything for this sprint was well organized and completed in time, while communicating regularly with all members of the team, but specially with Fernando, our Scrum Master, who did his job perfectly.

## Sprint 2

In this sprint I started to work on the urgent task of removing the CoreUI dependency. Later, I developed the mockup for the admin page and finally, worked on the development of the plugin removal functionality via the admin page.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [(#116) User Profile: remove CoreUI dependency](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/116)

This task needed to be urgently done since CoreUI was conflicting with other parts of the project, therefore it was treated with high priority. To accomplish this task, I immediately started exploring different alternatives to CoreUI alongside Fernando and we managed to reach the desired result while using Angular Material, Angular Flex Layout and regular CSS.

- [(#135) As an admin, I want to remove a plugin from the store on the admin dashboard.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/135)

For this task I implemented a list with all the plugins on the admin page, with the possibilty of removing them directly from that page while having to confirm the action on a pop-up. Fernando guided me during this implementation while we followed a pair-programming strategy. He also implemented the API route that I needed to use for the removal of the plugin.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [(#156) Refactor: Removal of CoreUI dependency from the User Profile component page](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/156)

This pull request merged the removal of the CoreUI dependency to the branch where every team was working from, so it was extremely important. It gave some conflicts, but after some time resolving them it was possible to merge the pull request, removing all the conflicts caused by CoreUI.

- [(#180) Feature: Removal of plugins from the store via the admin page](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/pull/180)

This PR merged the implementation of the plugin removal functionality, a task that was part of an "X-Large" user story.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- I made the mockup for the admin page through Figma. This mockup was the starting point for the user story related to the admin page.
- I was always active and communicated frequently with all teams, making myself available to help in what was necessary.
