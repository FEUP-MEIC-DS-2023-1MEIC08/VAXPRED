### The two user stories that I am most proud of

* As a researcher, I want to see a store-like grid when I go to the plugin store, so that I can easily see all the plugins available.#33 https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/33

It took me and the other product owners several tries to write good user stories, so when we finally did them, we were all very proud.

 ## Sprint 1

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

* As a researcher, I want to have access to the plugin's FAQ, so that I can clarify some common questions about the plugin.#83 (https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/83)
* As a researcher, I want to see the dependencies of a plugin, so that I can be aware if a specific plugin is compatible with the tools on my workspace.#80 (https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/80)

The reason why is because I believe that the implementation of this features will make the user experience easier.
