# Factsheet for Maria Sofia GonÃ§alves

## Sprint 0

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

* As a researcher, I want to have a profile page, so that I can see all the plugins I added to my workspaces.#34 https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/34
* As a researcher, I want to see a store-like grid when I go to the plugin store, so that I can easily see all the plugins available.#33 https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/33

It took me and the other product owners several tries to write good user stories, so when we finally did them, we were all very proud.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No pull requests were made during this sprint.


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

 * Writing the Roadmap [Roadmap](/docs/roadmap.png)
 * Writing the Product Vision [Product Vision](/docs/product.md)

It was difficult to compreend how to divide the work throught the sprints and to write a concise Product Vision. When these were finallly completed, I felt very proud of me and the other product owners.
