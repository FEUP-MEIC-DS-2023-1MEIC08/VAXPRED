# Factsheet for Mariana Azevedo

## Sprint 0

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * #1 "As a researcher, I want to be able to search for a plugin's name in the store, so that I can find it quickly." (issue #23)
 * #2 "As a researcher, I want to be able to filter the plugins by various tags, so that I can find the one that suits better the experiment I want to do."  (issue #24)

 I wrote these two user stories thinking that being able to better search for plugins in the store will improve the user-friendliness of the platform. The other POs helped revising the user stories.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No pull requests were made during this sprint.


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

 * #1 The writing of the Product Vision (product.md)
 * #2 The creation of the Domain Model  (product.md)

 Writing the Product Vision and creating the Domain Model together with the other POs was especially important for understanding what is supposed to be done on this project and will certainly be of much help in future sprints to be able to guide the teams and achieve the best results.
