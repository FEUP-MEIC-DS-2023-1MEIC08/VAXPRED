### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * "As a researcher, I want to have the plugins available in the store divided into categories or sections, so that I can view them in an organized way." [issue 14](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/14). 

 * "As a researcher, I want to see the plugin's description, so that I can have more info about it, such as where is it from, when it was created, if it is available, or if it has a cost." [issue 26](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/26)

I wrote these user stories in colaboration with the other product owners. I consider these essencial for achieving our product vision.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

As a PO, I did not participate in any pull request.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

 * The writing and refining of the [Product Vision](/docs/product.md), in colaboration with the other product owners, Sofia and Mariana.
 * The creation of the [Domain Model](/docs/product.md), which was improved with the aid of the other product owners, Sofia and Mariana.

Writing the Product Vision and creating the Domain Model together with the other POs was really important for understanding the direction that our future product must follows and the needs of our clients.


## Sprint 1

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

* "As a researcher, I want to have a catalogue with all the plugins available in the store, so that I can easily see what is available and have the important information to make a decision about what plugins to choose." [issue 32](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/32)
* "As a researcher, when accessing a plugin in the store I want to have printscreens of the tool that that plugin offers, so that I know if that tool will suit the research I am working on." [issue 82](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/82)

I chose these user stories because the firts user story was crucial to be implemented has it is necessary to the platform usability and the second one will improve the user experience in the next sprint.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

As a PO, I did not participate in any pull request, although I contributed to the definitions of Ready and Done and Market Research that were added to the docs folder and resulted in a pull request.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

* Doing more market research on stores with the other POs.
* Describing the Definitions of Ready and the Definition of Done with the other POs.
