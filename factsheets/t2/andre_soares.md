### The two user stories that I am most proud of

In this sprint I was involved with user [story #32](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/32). Even though we only had 1 user story assigned to our team in this sprint, I worked on 2 items [#60](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/60) and [#54](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/54) where I and Aníbal Ferreira developed the web routes regarding the relation between users and plugins as well as populating the plugins table, respectively.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

In this sprint I also helped my team in the decision of which attributes we would need to store concerning users and plugins and helped populate the users table. 

## Sprint 2

In this second sprint, I have been part of the integration of the web framework FastAPI as well as adding aditional features to the backend so that the front end has more direct routes.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

In this sprint I was involved with [user story #23](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/23), where I implemented a full text search feature on the database and made it possible for the frontend to send a get request with either the parts of the name or a word in the description and receive the correspondent(s) plugin(s)
I was also involved with [user story #153](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/153) where I created tests to verify if the full text search worked properly.
### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No important pull requests have been made by me.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

## Sprint 3

In this second sprint, I have been part of the improvement of the database with more features so that the front end can be improved and display more information

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

In this sprint I was involved with [user story #188](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/188), where I added a field to the plugin class to determine whether or not a plugin is premium (paid) or free. I used a simple integer (isFree) signifying if it is paid or not, this way the load on the database will be smaller if at scale.
I was also involved with [user story #119](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC08/VAXPRED/issues/119) where I created a dependencies class as well as an association class between dependencies and plugins, to this effect I also created a way to add a dependency to a plugin and to see both plugins that use a dependency and what dependencies a plugin uses (I made more routes but these are the most important).
### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No important pull requests have been made by me.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

In this sprint I also helped my team by improving prior sql scripts to account for new changes to the database, this means that post changes we can quickly recover our database preset
